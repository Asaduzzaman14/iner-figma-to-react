                The Indian real estate sector is resilient despite global
                headwinds. Returns are impressive and the sector is expected to
                reach US$ 1 trillion in market size by 2030 (Niti Aayog report,
                2021). However, the whole real estate purchase journey is very
                tedious and takes more than 2 years on average. Further, as the
                ticket size of this investment is large, security and trust
                become quite critical. Problems compound when you are currently
                away from your purchase destination. If you are experiencing
                difficulties in the real estate purchase journey, we are here to
                make it fast and transparent.
